![CI](https://github.com/overkilling/overkill-todo-spa-frontend/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

An overkill implementation of a Single Page Application (SPA) for managing todos, implemented in React.
It is an overkill as it is far too overengineered for a pet project, using Redux, Sagas, Material UI and all sorts of fancy frontend technology.

## Overview

The current architecture of the Todo application follows the Box-Box-Container model, or BBC for short.
It splits the architecture concerns into three layers: presentation, business logic and persistence.
In the context of the Todo application:

- The presentation layer is a [React Single Page Application (SPA)](https://github.com/overkilling/overkill-todo-spa-frontend)
- The business logic is a [Golang API](https://github.com/overkilling/overkill-todo-monolith-api)
- The persistence is a [Postgres database](https://www.postgresql.org/).

Below is colorful architecture diagram:

This is a fairly [standard architecture style](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PresentationDomainDataLayering.html), and it could considered a good starting point for most applications.
If/when an application grows in complexity and features, other patterns could be considered, such as microservices, event sourcing, CQRS and many more.
Hopefully these other patterns will be explored in other overkill implementations, so they can be evaluated and compared.

In this simple architecture, the SPA and API components where implemented in a slighlty overkill fashion.
This means that, even though the problem space can be considered quite simple, the solution has been overengineered to exercise and highlight certain techniques and methodologies.
E.g. both `BasicAuth` and `JWT` authentication methods will be supported, it will include REST and `GraphQL` APIs, logs and metrics will be gathered.
The intent is to provide some practice to the developer and, perhaps, some education to the readers.

Although this repository only contains the SPA component, there's an [infrastructure repository](https://github.com/overkilling/overkill-todo-infrastructure) which ties the whole application together.
It allows to start the application locally through `docker-compose`, but it doesn't deploy it yet to any real environment.
